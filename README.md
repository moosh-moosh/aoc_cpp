# Advent of Code... In C++

I don't know how to write C++.

## TODOs

* Figure out how to properly throw exceptions, right now using `throw "error description";` in a couple of places which does not seem to actually work.
* Write a Makefile for building this thing, now using a horrible bash script
* Learn more about building these things in general, I don't know what I'm doing
* Maybe create some kind of a util file for stuff that is repeated in a bunch of files like reading the input and then figure out how to use that in all the source files
